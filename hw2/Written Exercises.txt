Q1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
A1. setImmediate faster than setTimeout because setImmediate  checks queue of I/O eventhandlers.
 If all I/O events in the current snapshot are processed, it executes the callback. 
 It queues them immedieately after the last I/O handler somewhat like process.nextTick.
  So it is faster. and also setTimeout has to pass through timers queue performing any 
  operations specific to each phase before executing callback


Q2. Explain the difference between process.NextTick and setImmediate?
 A2.   process.NextTick has no crap and it's out of the eventloop and has the higher priority to execure all it's callback before start executing the callback of the event loop,
    whereas setImmediate is a part of the eventloop which has to pass through all the times queue.
